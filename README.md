# Scenerios
Scenario:
•	The user will input the data consider be it in CSV format.
•	Then they will determine which is the target variable.
•	The data will then go through a data preprocessing step which will include series of steps like data cleaning (handling outliers, handling missing data, handling noisy data), data integration (handling duplicate data), data reduction (dimensionality reduction, remove irrelevant features, aggregation), data transformation (scalarization, normalization, encoding), etc.
•	The dataset then produced will be then fitted against multiple models with hyperparameter tuning to get the best fit model.
•	The user will be shown the best fit model and will be given an option to download the model.
Additional Features:
•	The user can choose from the list of algos to train model on.
•	The user can download other models also, that were trained.
•	The refined dataset can also be given to the user for downloading and viewing purpose.
•	In this approach we were creating one refined dataset and applying on it multiple algorithms.
•	Another approach could be we create multiple datasets using data preprocessing techniques and then apply on them multiple algorithms to get the best results.

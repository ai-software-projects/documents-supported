<h1>Scenarios</h1>

<h2>Scenario:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The user inputs data, which may be in CSV format.</li>
  <li>They determine the target variable from the input data.</li>
  <li>The data undergoes preprocessing steps, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Data cleaning (handling outliers, missing data, noisy data).</li>
      <li>Data integration (handling duplicate data).</li>
      <li>Data reduction (dimensionality reduction, removing irrelevant features, aggregation).</li>
      <li>Data transformation (scalarization, normalization, encoding), etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The preprocessed dataset is fitted against multiple models with hyperparameter tuning to find the best-fit model.</li>
  <li>The user is shown the best-fit model and given the option to download it.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Additional Features:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The user can choose from a list of algorithms to train the model on.</li>
  <li>They can download other trained models as well.</li>
  <li>The refined dataset can be provided to the user for downloading and viewing purposes.</li>
  <li>In this approach, one refined dataset is created and applied to multiple algorithms.</li>
  <li>Another approach could involve creating multiple datasets using data preprocessing techniques and then applying multiple algorithms to them to obtain the best results.</li>
</ul>
